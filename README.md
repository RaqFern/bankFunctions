## The scope of the project is: 
In a bank, to register a bank account, you must provide the account number, the name of the account holder, and the initial deposit amount that the holder deposited when opening an account. This deposit amount initial deposit, however, is optional, that is: if the holder does not have money to deposit at the time of opening his
account, the initial deposit will not be made and the initial account balance will naturally be zero.
Important: Once a bank account has been opened, the account number can never be changed. Already
the name of the holder can be changed (as a person can change their name upon marriage, for
example).

Finally, the account balance cannot be changed freely. There needs to be a mechanism to protect
that. The balance only increases through deposits, and only decreases through withdrawals. For each withdrawal
carried out, the bank charges a fee of $5.00. Note: the account may have a negative balance if the balance is not
enough to make the withdrawal and/or pay the fee.

**You must create a program that registers an account, giving you the option to be registered or not.
inform the amount of the initial deposit. Then, make a deposit and then a withdrawal, always
showing account details after each operation**
